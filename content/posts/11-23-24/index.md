# Consider This Version 1.0

So my main goal was to get this up and running, and I've done that. Now it will take time to do the basic stuff - what will this be about, what will I have **time for**, and what features can I implement. 

This will also serve as an active learning experience for me. I must admit, I had no real tie to Hugo, and simply selected it after a little research. I may work on another site under a different platform (Astro). 

## To Do for Version 1.1
~~* Fix the Resume link at the top of the page~~
* "Recent" section doesn't appear the way it should. No actual Recent link appears.

~~* Get a Bluesky link added.~~

That's a start!
